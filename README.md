- Three pricing tiers with icons, features list, prices and CTA buttons
- Fully responsive (side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Hover effects on buttons (scale + shadow)
- CSS custom properties for easy theming
- Modern design with shadows and rounded corners

### About this project
My **first ever** CSS project during Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy.

**Key point:** Built independently from a design screenshot (not code-along), with small custom adjustments to the original design.

Goal: Practice pure CSS layout, Flexbox, responsive design and UI details during career transition to frontend development.
